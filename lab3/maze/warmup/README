README
This mine.py module include has some functions
that would recursively update a mineswepper board
given a board in a 2x2 array and a location given by 
a 1x2 array where the first term is the x and the second 
term is the y.

Usage:
one can simply run the file in python3 to determine whether the 
included test cases pass the test given on the webpage, 
if they do then a statement will print.
if one wishes to use this module, the way to interface with the
board update method is by calling 

mine.adjustboard(board, clicklocation):

where board is a 2x2 matrix representing the board 
and click location is a 1x2 matrix representing an 
x,y coordinate pair of the location the user intends to 
click*(e.g.  [1,2] ).
