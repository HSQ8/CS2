the errors were

memory leak:
tree is not being properly deleted, so I created a delete method
(i was considering writing a proper destructor, but since the
original main function declares the bst on the stack, and not on the heap, I couldn't have called delete to invoke a ~destructor)
afterwards i confirmed in valgrind that there are no memory
leaks

segfault:
when adding the first node, we don't check whether
it has been initialized, its a null ptr that we try to dereference

there may be other errors that I don't remember fixing when i fixed 
it since I'm writing this readme 4 days after.
