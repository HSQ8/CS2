What part of the above algorithm uses dynamic programming?
/**
 * the algorithm computes the seam matrix dynamically, as we break the cost matrix computation into rows
 * and compute on the smaller parts of the problem one at a time and saving the computation from the next level
 */
The seam-finding algorithm can be implemented recursively, without dynamic programming. Explain how.
/**
 * if we don't remember the previous level for the cost matrix, then every level would have to be computed recursively all the way
 * from the bottom for each step we want to take in the seam. This would not have dynamic programming as we don't remember the intermediate solutions
 * for the cases that we already test.
 */
For an NxN image, what is the complexity of the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming? State the complexity in big-O notation, as a function of N.
/**
 * the time complexity involves, for each pixel in n pixels, we must compute 3 previous pixels per level for n levels, summing gets us N*3^n computations, do this for we get = O(N*3^N)
 * 
 */
Using the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming, how long would it take to find a seam on a 50x50 image if 1 billion computations were made per second? State a reasonable lower bound. Hint: The answer should be huge.
/**
 *  =50 *(3)^50/(1*10^9) = 3.589 * 10^16 seconds, if we assume that the function only grew exponentially(by providing a reasonable lower bound) without the linear coefficient in front, that time is still
 * 7.17897987691852588770249 Ã— 10^14 seconds
 */

For an NxN image, what is the complexity of the algorithm using dynamic programming?
/**
 * since we store the value of previous computation, we get 3 computations per pixel for total of 3N^2 computations. Which, dropping the constant, gets us O(N^2)
 */
Using the dynamic programming algorithm, how long would it take to find a seam on the same image as before (#4)?
/**
 * 3N^2/(1*10^9) for N = 50  solution = 7.5 * 10^(-6)
