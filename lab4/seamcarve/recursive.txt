The seam-finding algorithm can be implemented recursively, without dynamic programming. Explain how.

For an NxN image, what is the complexity of the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming? State the complexity in big-O notation, as a function of N.
/**

 * @type {[type]}
 */
Using the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming, how long would it take to find a seam on a 50x50 image if 1 billion computations were made per second? State a reasonable lower bound. Hint: The answer should be huge.
